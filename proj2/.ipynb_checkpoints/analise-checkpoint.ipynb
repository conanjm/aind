       "<p>Planning is an important topic in AI because intelligent agents are expected to automatically plan their own actions in uncertain domains. Planning and scheduling systems are commonly used in automation and logistics operations, robotics and self-driving cars, and for aerospace applications like the Hubble telescope and NASA Mars rovers.</p>\n",
       "<p>This project is split between implementation and analysis. First you will combine symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Then you will experiment with different search algorithms and heuristics, and use the results to answer questions about designing planning systems.</p>\n",
       "<p>Read all of the instructions below and the project rubric <a href=\"https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1800/view\">here</a> carefully before starting the project so that you understand the requirements for successfully completing the project. Understanding the project requirements will help you avoid repeating parts of the experiment, some of which can have long runtimes.</p>\n",
       "<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You should read \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\" 3rd edition chapter 10 <em>or</em> 2nd edition Chapter 11 on Planning, available <a href=\"http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/2nd-ed/newchap11.pdf\">on the AIMA book site</a> before starting this project.</p>\n",

(NOTE: Workspaces does not currently support pypy3, so your code will run slower than completing the project locally if you install pypy3.) </p>\n",
       "<p>If you use the Workspace, you do NOT need to perform any of the setup steps outlined below. Skip to the next section with instructions for completing the project.</p>\n",

Pypy is an alternative to the standard cPython runtime that tries to optimize and selectively compile your code for improved speed, and it can run 2-10x faster for this project. There are binaries available for Linux, Windows, and OS X. Simply download and run the appropriate pypy binary installer (make sure you get version 3.5) or use the package manager for your OS. When properly installed, any <code>python</code> commands can be run with <code>pypy</code> instead. (You may need to specify <code>pypy3</code> on some OSes.)</p>\n",

For example, the <code>Expr</code> class used for symbolic representations of the actions and literals is <em>very</em> slow (the time to do basic operations like negating an object can be 1000x slower than more optimal representations). And the inconsistent effects, interference, and negation mutexes are static for a given problem domain; they do not need to be checked each time a layer is added to the planning graph.</p>\n",

The complete list of states and complete list of actions are known when the planning graph instance is created (they're static), and the set of static mutexes is also fixed. A single list can be used to track the first layer at which each literal or action enter the planning graph (they will remain in the graph in all future layers), and a single list can be used to track when mutexes first leave the graph (they will remain out of the graph in all future layers).</li>\n",
